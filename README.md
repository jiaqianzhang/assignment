Name: Jia Zhang, Laura Wei, Manar Saighi

Student Number: C21408862, C21371683, C21440946

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
For this assignment we were required to create an abstract visual story of a song. The Song we chose to use is ‘Believer’ by imagine dragons. The song has four choruses, each team member took ownership of one section. we came up with ideas and worked on part of it together the rest is individual work. 

We used a mix of 2D and 3D visuals in the program. Our first visual featured a heart pulsated in sync with the amplitude of the music. Captivating the song’s emotional impact. Our second visual contains blue sea waves intermingled with rain, stars, lightning and a radiant  sun in the center of the screen surrounded by spheres that added depth and dimension. Our third visual is a depiction of human brain with blue spheres surrounding it, with a pattern of sound waves at the bottom adding layers to our creation.

# How it works

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
We are proud of figuring out how to combine each of our visuals and make the pressing keys work. And we learnt how to set up our own git repository and how we can all collaborate and allowing us to appreciate the progress we made as a team. We played around with each other’s code and helped each other out.

We are especially proud of our third visual as it look one of our team member a lot of time and effort to do it line by line.

We are proud of all our visuals, through effective communication and teamwork we overcame issues and tried our best to make the visuals appealing. The end result is satisfying and we all felt accomplished.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
